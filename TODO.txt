1. Add changelog
2. Old GH #25

   using vim-makejob with the following make prg:

       set makeprg=([[\ -f\ Makefile\ ]]\ &&\ (make\ $*;\ true)\\\|\\\|\ latexmk\ -lualatex\ \"%\"\ $*)

   This works fine with :make, but when I run :MakeJob it fails to run
   (Return 122 with findings) and the quickfix list is empty. There is
   no Makefile.
3. Neovim support

INTRODUCTION                                    *makejob* *nvim-makejob*

There are plenty of other build solutions for Vim and Neovim, many of them
offering feature sets that overlap with those the editor already offers. With
minimalism as a goal, MakeJob implements asynchronous |:make| and |:lmake| for
Neovim in just over 100 lines of Vimscript.

Here are your new make commands.

                                                *makejob-MakeJob*
MakeJob [{bufname}]         Start a makejob on the specified buffer,
                            populating findings in the quickfix list.
                            |makeprg| and |errorformat| must be set before
                            MakeJob is called. {bufname}, if specified, is the
                            name of the file to make, and is appended to the
                            end of |makeprg|. MakeJob currently only expands
                            the special character % (see |_%|).

                                                *makejob-LmakeJob*
LmakeJob [{bufname}]        Same as ":MakeJob", except the location list for
                            the current window is used instead of the quickfix
                            list.

INTRODUCTION                                    *makejob* *vim-makejob*

This is a plugin for folks who think that Vim's quickfix feature is
great, but who don't like how calls to |:make| and |:grep| freeze the
editor. _MakeJob_ implements asynchronous versions of the builtin
commands in just over 150 lines of Vimscript.

{only available in Vim version 8 or later}
{only when compiled with the |channel|, |job|, and |quickfix| features}

Here are your new quickfix commands.

                                                *makejob-MakeJob*
MakeJob[!] [{filename}]     Start a makejob on the specified buffer,
                            populating findings in the quickfix list.
                            |makeprg| and |errorformat| must be set before
                            MakeJob is called. {filename}, if specified, is the
                            name of the file to make, and is appended to the
                            end of |makeprg|. Ex special characters are
                            expanded (see |cmdline-special|). |autowrite|,
                            |QuickFixCmdPre|, and |QuickFixCmdPost| all
                            work as expected. While the job runs, output
                            will be directed to a preview buffer below
                            the active buffer. If [!] is not given, the
                            first error is jumped to.

                                                *makejob-LmakeJob*
LmakeJob[!] [{filename}]    Same as ":MakeJob", except the location list for
                            the current window is used instead of the quickfix
                            list.

                                                *makejob-GrepJob*
GrepJob[!] {filename}       Run the grep command specified in |grepprg|
                            and read into the quickfix list using
                            |grepformat|. {filename} must be specified,
                            but can contain wildcards.

                                                *makejob-LgrepJob*
LgrepJob[!] {filename}      Same as ":GrepJob", except the location list for
                            the current window is used instead of the quickfix
                            list.

                                                *makejob-GrepaddJob*
GrepaddJob[!] {filename}    Same as ":GrepJob", but add findings to the
                            quickfix list without clearing it first.

                                                *makejob-LgrepaddJob*
GrepaddJob[!] {filename}    Same as ":LrepJob", but add findings to the
                            location list without clearing it first.

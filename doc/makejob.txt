                                MakeJob  *makejob* *vim-makejob*

This is a plugin for folks who think that Vim's quickfix feature is
great, but who don't like how calls to |:make| and |:grep| freeze the
editor. MakeJob implements asynchronous versions of the builtin
commands in just over 150 lines of Vimscript.

1. MakeJob Commands                     *makejob-commands*

Here are your new quickfix commands.

                                        *makejob-MakeJob* *:MakeJob*
MakeJob[!] [{filename}]     Start a makejob on the specified buffer,
                            populating findings in the quickfix list.
                            |makeprg| and |errorformat| must be set before
                            MakeJob is called. {filename}, if specified, is
                            the name of the file to make, and is appended to
                            the end of |makeprg|. Ex special characters are
                            expanded (see |cmdline-special|). |autowrite|,
                            |QuickFixCmdPre|, and |QuickFixCmdPost| all work
                            as expected. While the job runs, output will be
                            directed to a preview buffer below the active
                            buffer. If [!] is not given, the first error is
                            jumped to.

                                        *makejob-LmakeJob* *:LmakeJob*
LmakeJob[!] [{filename}]    Same as ":MakeJob", except the location list for
                            the current window is used instead of the quickfix
                            list.

                                        *makejob-GrepJob* *:GrepJob*
GrepJob[!] {filename}       Run the grep command specified in |grepprg| and
                            read into the quickfix list using |grepformat|.
                            {filename} must be specified, but can contain
                            wildcards.

                                        *makejob-LgrepJob* *:LgrepJob*
LgrepJob[!] {filename}      Same as ":GrepJob", except the location list for
                            the current window is used instead of the quickfix
                            list.

                                        *makejob-GrepaddJob* *:GrepaddJob*
GrepaddJob[!] {filename}    Same as ":GrepJob", but add findings to the
                            quickfix list without clearing it first.

                                        *makejob-LgrepaddJob* *:LgrepaddJob*
LgrepaddJob[!] {filename}   Same as ":GrepaddJob", but add findings to the
                            location list without clearing it first.

2. CONFIGURATION                        *makejob-configuration*

                                        *g:makejob_hide_preview_window*
                                        number (default 0)
g:makejob_hide_preview_window       Hide the preview window during execution.
                                    Default (0) is to show the preview window.
                                    Set to 1 to hide it.
